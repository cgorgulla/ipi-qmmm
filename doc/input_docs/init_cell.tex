{\ipiitem{mode}%
{This decides whether the system box is created from a cell parameter matrix, or from the side lengths and angles between them. If 'mode' is 'manual', then 'cell' takes a 9-elements vector containing the cell matrix (row-major). If 'mode' is 'abcABC', then 'cell' takes an array of 6 floats, the first three being the length of the sides of the system parallelopiped, and the last three being the angles (in degrees) between those sides. Angle A corresponds to the angle between sides b and c, and so on for B and C. If mode is 'abc', then this is the same as for 'abcABC', but the cell is assumed to be orthorhombic. 'pdb' and 'chk' read the cell from a PDB or a checkpoint file, respectively.}%
{default: `manual'; data type: string; options: `manual', `pdb', `chk', `abc', `abcABC'; }%
