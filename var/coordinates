ipi does internally all with au
- coordinates
- cell matrix



PBC wrapping
- only uses for drivers on the fly
- shrinks everything at first such that the unit cell has lenght 1 in all directions
- rounds all coordinates -> centers the small unit box
- increases the size again by multi with the cell matrix



files
- ipi assumes that all is au unless otherwise specified
- even though angstrom is std for xyz, pdb, as they also write in the manual

atom coordinates
- either specifying the units in the via the xml attribute "<file units="angstrom">..."
-- but this is soon depreciated as they write
-- affects both cell and atom positions
- recommended: in the coordinate files only
-- there atom and cell positions can also have different units
-- but: I tried it, it didn't work for pdb, just assumed it is in angstrom

-- careful! if unit in the coord file and in ipi input file specified then doubel conversion!!!a
